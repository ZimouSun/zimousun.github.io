<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
The goal of this assignment to develop an algorithm that is capable of detecting different hand shapes or gestures.   What
needs to be solved?  Why is the result useful?  Do you make any assumptions?
What are the anticipated difficulties?
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<p>This program was implemented in Python 3 with supports from openCV and numpy libraries. 
 It will read video frames through a webcam, and detects if the videos contain any of the four given kinds of hand shapes
 and one hand gesture. There is a window, which will display the hand shape or gesture as soon as the algorithm recoginzed it.
 <br>
 Preprocessing Video Frame :
 <br>
 The first stage is preprocess video frames. For each frame we apply skin detection, and use the OpenCV librarcy function "cv2.findContours"
 to help identify the hand region of the original frame image. In skin detection, we set up a threshold B>20 , G > 40, R >150, and 
 assign (255,255,255) to the pixels passed. Then the next task will be calling "findContours" function to find a list of boundingboxes
 from the preprocessing frame.  And we pick the boundingbox that give us the largest area to return.
  
<br>
Hand Shape Detection:
<br>
For hand shape Detection we have created a set of binary template for 4 kinds of hand shapes and use template matching to identify 
valid hand shape from the input. We first resize the template to the same dimensions of the hand image(from preprocessing), then we call 
call the openCV "absdiff" function to calculate the absoulute difference between the template and the hand image. We also create a flipped 
version of the template, to cover the hand shape in the other direction. The smaller the difference between the image and the template the 
more likely it is a match. Eventually, there is a the max difference value and a boundingbox size check to guard the validity of our dection.
<br>

Hand Movement Detection:
<br>
For hand movement "waving", we have two type of binary template, frame-to-frame differencing templates set and
motion energy templates set, and two corresponding (types of) the hand image. To detect, we calculate the normalized correlation coefficient
 for each template-"hand image" pair, and submit the maximum NCC score to final check. We set a threshold for waving's NCC score(0.5),
 and a minimum size check for the hand image. Additionally, to speed up the computation, the mean and standard 
 deviation of templates were precalculated.

performed, and the relevant parameter values.  </p>
<p>
Define your evaluation
metrics, e.g., detection rates, accuracy, running time. </p>

<h2> Discussion </h2>

<p> 
Discuss your method and results:
</p><ul>
<li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of your method? </li>
<li>Do your results show that your method is generally successful or
     are there limitations? Describe what you expected to find in your
     experiments, and how that differed or was confirmed by your
     results. </li>
<li>Potential future work. How could your method be improved?   What
would you try (if you had more time) to overcome the
failures/limitations of your work?</li> 
</ul>
