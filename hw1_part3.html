<h1> CS585hw1_part3 </h1>

img src=<"2020_2_2_selfie.jpg" alt = "my selfie">

<p> This is the original image of myself</p>

img src=<"GrayScale.jpg" alt = "my selfie GrayScale version">

<p> This the grayscale version of the BGR image 

<br> and each pixel has 3 color channels

<br> weighted by [0.1, 0.6, 0.3] of the original image's BGR value

</p>

img src=<"blur.jpg" alt = "my selfie blur version">

<p> This is the blur version of the BGR image

<br> I use a 7*7 filter to process each pixel with itself and its neighnbors' BGR values

<br> the weights of neighboring pixels are assigned using guassian distribution based on distance 

<br> to make the blur more visible I run the blurring algorithm multiple times
